	<description>&lt;b&gt;Not Just Another Prostheses Mod&lt;/b&gt;. An expansion of vanilla medical system and how they work. Adds full featured prosthesis that uses vanilla standard and integration with another mod. New Prosthesis System allows you to install prosthetic modules on installed prosthesis.

&lt;size=24&gt;Main Features&lt;/size&gt;
- Installed prostheses can keep there child parts. Now you don't get missing fingers when installed hand prosthesis or missing toes when installed foot prosthesis.
- New exclusive body part system framework and it's modules. Allows you to install prosthetic modules on installed prosthesis.
&lt;b&gt;This two main features only work on bionic and archotech body parts&lt;/b&gt;. It doesn't make sense to me for basic and simple body parts can have this features.
- New organ transplant rejection, prosthesis limb and bone adaptation system, and implant complication. Some of this is never done by another mod.
This mod not really that OP. &lt;b&gt;Raider chance to spawn with prostheses parts and implants now higher and also have same part system feature&lt;/b&gt;.
- New exclusive implant system framework. Now you can install implant on installed prosthesis part. of course there's a limit of how many implant can be installed on installed prosthesis part.

&lt;b&gt;Other Features&lt;/b&gt;
